# Notes on analysis of soybean aphid low-dose insecticide RNA-Seq experiment.

## General overview

Analysis steps will be recorded in a Makefile for repeatability. Results and observations will be recorded in these notes. Git will be used to track changes in the Makefile and these notes. Intermediate output and data files will not generally be included in the git repo because the files are usually very large. We may add the raw data to the repo later so the repo includes everything needed to repeat the analysis.
